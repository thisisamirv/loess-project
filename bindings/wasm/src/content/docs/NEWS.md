# fastloess-wasm (development version)

## Changed

* Consolidated every crate/binding README: merged the "Installation" and "Documentation" sections, replaced GitHub-only alert syntax with plain blockquotes, removed the redundant "API Reference" and "Changelog" sections (each now has its own docs-site page), and added a "Read more" link to the Concepts page. The top-level repository README is unchanged, since it's only ever viewed on GitHub.
* Renamed the batch adapter's "When to Use" heading to "When to Use Batch Adapter" across every binding/crate's API docs.
* Vendored the [doxygen-awesome-css](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css) theme (v2.4.2) for a modern, sidebar-only cpp Doxygen site with automatic dark mode.
* Added `dev/update_changelogs.py`, which regenerates a per-binding/crate `NEWS.md`/`news.md` from the root `CHANGELOG.md`. Wired into every docs site's navigation, the Rust crates' rustdoc module tree, and every `Makefile` `dev` target.
* Updated `typedoc-plugin-markdown` to v4.13.
* `make wasm-dev` now runs `npm update` after `npm install`, so dependencies are kept current.

## Fixed

* Fixed `docs.yml` triggering GitHub's "pages build and deployment" once per docs job; per-language jobs now upload artifacts, and a single final `deploy` job pushes to `gh-pages` once per run.
* Same fix as Node.js: `README.md` is now embedded via `dev/add-readme-to-docs.js`, wired into `npm run docs` and `make wasm-dev`.
* Fixed `concepts.md` figures (MkDocs-only `<figure>`/attr_list syntax) not rendering; converted to plain images with italicized captions.
* Fixed inline/display LaTeX math rendering as literal text; wired `remark-math`/`rehype-katex` into `astro.config.mjs`.

# fastloess-wasm 1.1.0

## Added

* Added a GitHub Pages landing page at the repository root, built from `README.md` via pandoc and deployed by `docs.yml`.
* Added a GitHub workflow for running validation scripts.
* Added `npm run lint` to the `Lint` step in `ci-wasm.yml`, so JavaScript source and test files are linted via `oxlint` on every CI run.

## Changed

* Split the monolithic `.github/workflows/ci.yml` into seven per-language workflow files: `ci-rust.yml`, `ci-python.yml`, `ci-julia.yml`, `ci-nodejs.yml`, `ci-wasm.yml`, `ci-cpp.yml`, and `ci-r.yml`. Each file carries the relevant `ci` (multi-OS matrix), `asan`, and `gpu` jobs for its language.
* Each crate/binding sub-Makefile now runs `dev/verify_snippets.py --lang <lang>` for its own language as the final step of `make default`. The root `docs-test` target remains as a convenience to run all languages at once.
* Split every sub-Makefile `default:` into `default:` (build and system install) and `dev:` (full quality-check workflow). Both root Makefiles gain `<name>-dev` targets for each binding and crate, and an `all-dev` aggregate target.
* Split `dev/verify_snippets.py` into a lean orchestrator and a `dev/runners/` package. Each language has its own module (`python.py`, `julia.py`, `nodejs.py`, `r.py`, `wasm.py`, `rust.py`, `cpp.py`) containing its `run_<lang>()` function and a `skip_reason()` predicate. Shared types (`Snippet`, `RunResult`) and utilities live in `runners/base.py`; the registry (`RUNNERS`, `SKIP_CHECKS`) is exported from `runners/__init__.py`.
* Moved CHANGELOG and CONTRIBUTING guides to project root.
* Updated README files to be binding/crate specific instead of one generic README for all bindings/crates.
* Moved WASM documentation from ReadTheDocs to GitHub Pages, served by Starlight at <https://thisisamirv.github.io/loess-project/wasm/>. The ReadTheDocs site no longer includes WASM-specific content. `dev/add-wasm-outputs.js` runs as part of `make wasm-dev`, executing each JavaScript code block in the docs and injecting its output back into the Markdown source.
* `make wasm` (`default:`) now builds both the Node.js and web WASM targets and links the Node.js package globally via `npm link`. The full dev workflow moves to `make wasm-dev`.
* Updated `oxlint` dependency to 1.80.
* Replace the outdated `jetli/wasm-pack-action` workflow with `taiki-e/install-action`.

## Fixed

* Fixed `.cargo/config.toml` hardcoding absolute `c:/rtools45/...` paths for the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` linker and ar tool. Replaced with bare tool names resolved via `PATH`, matching the existing fix in `bindings/r/src/cargo-config.toml`.

# fastloess-wasm 1.0.0

## Fixed

* Fixed `OnlineLoess.add_point()` returning `undefined` instead of `null` when the sliding window has not yet accumulated enough points.

## Changed

* Removed `dev/isolate_cargo.py`, `dev/check_root_cargo.py`, `dev/fix_doc_snippets.py`, and `check_js_licenses.js` — workspace isolation, doc-snippet transformation, and license checks are no longer needed.
* Split the monolithic root `Makefile` into per-crate/binding sub-Makefiles (e.g. `crates/loess-rs/Makefile`, `bindings/r/Makefile`), each invokable directly via `make -f path/Makefile`. The root `Makefile` now only aggregates (`docs`, `check-msrv`, `all*`).
* Moved Rust and binding tests into their respective crate/binding directories (e.g. `tests/loess-rs/` → `crates/loess-rs/tests/loess-rs/`, `tests/cpp/` → `bindings/cpp/tests/`). Removed the standalone `tests/` workspace packages.
* Renamed `OnlineOutput`'s `smoothed` and `std_error` getters to `y` and `standard_error`. This is a **breaking change**.
* Updated `oxlint` to v1.79.

# fastloess-wasm 0.9.0

## Added

* Added Python, R, WASM, Node.js, C++, and Julia bindings.

## Changed

* Implement monorepo structure.
* Converted all documentation tables to compact single-space format.
* Updated `.clang-tidy` to configure `lower_case` as the required naming convention for functions and member functions, matching the new snake_case public API.
* Moved `BENCHMARKS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` from the repository root into `docs/` and added them to the documentation site navigation.
