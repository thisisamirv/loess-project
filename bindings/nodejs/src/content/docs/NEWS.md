# fastloess (Node.js) (development version)

## Changed

* Added a `large` benchmark category to `benchmarks/rfastloess.R` and `benchmarks/stats_loess.R` with 4 scenarios stressing different parameters at scale (n = 50000 unless noted): `large_direct` (`surface = "direct"`, disabling `loess`'s k-d tree interpolation shortcut for an exact fit), `large_interp` (same workload with the default interpolating surface, showing the shortcut's speedup), `large_high_iter` (n = 15000, `family = "symmetric"` and 10 robustness iterations instead of 3 — `family = "symmetric"` is required for `stats::loess` to actually perform robustness reweighting; the default `family = "gaussian"` ignores `loess.control`'s `iterations` entirely), and `large_high_fraction` (`span = 0.67`, since a wide window is costly even with the interpolation shortcut active). `benchmarks/compare.py`'s plot grid grew from 5x2 to 7x2 rows to fit the new categories.
* Consolidated every crate/binding README: merged the "Installation" and "Documentation" sections, replaced GitHub-only alert syntax with plain blockquotes, removed the redundant "API Reference" and "Changelog" sections (each now has its own docs-site page), and added a "Read more" link to the Concepts page. The top-level repository README is unchanged, since it's only ever viewed on GitHub.
* Renamed the batch adapter's "When to Use" heading to "When to Use Batch Adapter" across every binding/crate's API docs.
* Vendored the [doxygen-awesome-css](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css) theme (v2.4.2) for a modern, sidebar-only cpp Doxygen site with automatic dark mode.
* Added `dev/update_changelogs.py`, which regenerates a per-binding/crate `NEWS.md`/`news.md` from the root `CHANGELOG.md`. Wired into every docs site's navigation, the Rust crates' rustdoc module tree, and every `Makefile` `dev` target.
* Replaced `kernels.md`'s "Choosing a Kernel" mermaid flowchart (every binding/crate) with an equivalent decision table, since Doxygen and rustdoc don't render mermaid and the deeply-nested diamond chain was hard to read even where it did render.
* Replaced `adapter-choice.md`/`adapters.md`'s "Overview" flowchart (mermaid in most bindings/crates, ASCII art in the C++ docs) with an equivalent decision table, unifying on a single rendering-agnostic format across every binding/crate.
* Consolidated `parameters.md`/the auto-generated `@autodocs` parameter reference across every binding and crate (C++, Julia, Node.js, Python, WASM, `fastLoess`, `loess-rs`): merged its unique content (fraction/iterations choice guidance, and inline `zero_weight_fallback`/`surface_mode` behavior tables) into each `api.md`'s builder/options tables (Julia: into the `Loess`/`StreamingLoess`/`OnlineLoess` docstrings), and removed `parameters.md` itself along with its docs-site navigation entries, `doc::parameters` rustdoc module, and cross-references (now pointing at `api.md`) — the parameter tables, kernel/robustness/boundary/scaling/degree/distance-metric option lists, and interval/custom-weights code examples it duplicated already live on their own dedicated pages.
* Updated `typedoc-plugin-markdown` to v4.13.
* `make nodejs-dev` now runs `npm update` after `npm install`, so dependencies are kept current.

## Fixed

* Fixed every benchmark category in `benchmarks/rfastloess.R` failing with `attempt to apply non-function`: it called the R6-style `model$fit(x, y)`, but `fit` is an S3 generic (`fit(model, x, y)`), not a field on the `Loess` object.
* Fixed `docs.yml` triggering GitHub's "pages build and deployment" once per docs job; per-language jobs now upload artifacts, and a single final `deploy` job pushes to `gh-pages` once per run.
* Fixed `docs.yml`'s reliance on GitHub's legacy branch-based Pages deployment, which auto-triggers an unpinned, GitHub-managed "pages build and deployment" job on every `gh-pages` push (surfacing deprecation warnings, e.g. for Node.js 20, that aren't fixable from this repo). The former `deploy` job is now `build`, which still pushes the merged `_site` to `gh-pages` as a cache for future incremental runs, but publishing now goes through `actions/upload-pages-artifact` and a new `deploy` job using the official `actions/deploy-pages`, which this repo pins directly. Requires the repository's Pages source to be switched to "GitHub Actions" in settings.
* Fixed the "Handling Outliers" quickstart example (every binding and the `loess-rs`/`fastLoess` crates) printing nothing: with only 6 points and `fraction = 0.5`, the local window is small enough that tricube weighting drives the farthest neighbor's weight to ~0, leaving just 2 effectively-weighted points, which a degree-1 fit reproduces exactly (zero residual, no downweighting) — confirmed directly against the `lowess`/`loess` core, not binding-specific. Bumped to `fraction = 0.7`, which correctly downweights the injected outlier.
* Fixed the R `OnlineLoess()` roxygen example printing one line per point (48 lines for a 50-point loop); it now collects the smoothed values and prints only `head(smoothed, 5)`.
* Fixed the R `add_point()` roxygen example always printing `NULL`, since a single call never reaches the default `min_points = 3`; it now uses `min_points = 2L` and shows the second (non-`NULL`) call's result.
* Fixed the Julia `intervals.md` "Confidence Intervals" and "Standard Errors" examples each looping over all 100 points instead of a short sample; switched to `result.y[1:5]`/`result.confidence_lower[1:5]`/`result.standard_errors[1:5]`-style slicing, matching the already-concise Python version.
* Fixed the docs homepage never showing the README content ("Get Started" jumped straight to Installation): a new `dev/add-readme-to-docs.js` script embeds `README.md` below the hero (stripping its redundant `# LOESS Project` H1, since the hero already shows the title), wired into `npm run docs` and `make nodejs-dev`.
* Fixed the docs build always emitting a `[@astrojs/sitemap] The Sitemap integration requires the site astro.config option` warning when the `SITE` environment variable isn't set (e.g. local builds); `astro.config.mjs` now falls back to the production GitHub Pages URL.
* Fixed every link on the "API Reference" page 404ing: TypeDoc's markdown output preserves the original TypeScript symbol casing (e.g. `classes/Loess.md`) and Astro renders those relative links verbatim, but Starlight always lowercases content-collection route slugs (e.g. `classes/loess/`) and never actually strips the `.md` extension automatically. A new `dev/lowercase-typedoc-refs.js` script lowercases every generated reference file name and rewrites their internal links (stripped of `.md`, also lowercased) after `typedoc` runs and before `astro build`, wired into `npm run docs`.

# fastloess (Node.js) 1.1.0

## Added

* Added a GitHub Pages landing page at the repository root, built from `README.md` via pandoc and deployed by `docs.yml`.
* Added a GitHub workflow for running validation scripts.
* Added `npm run lint` to the `Lint` step in `ci-nodejs.yml`, so JavaScript source and test files are linted via `oxlint` on every CI run.

## Changed

* Split the monolithic `.github/workflows/ci.yml` into seven per-language workflow files: `ci-rust.yml`, `ci-python.yml`, `ci-julia.yml`, `ci-nodejs.yml`, `ci-wasm.yml`, `ci-cpp.yml`, and `ci-r.yml`. Each file carries the relevant `ci` (multi-OS matrix), `asan`, and `gpu` jobs for its language.
* Each crate/binding sub-Makefile now runs `dev/verify_snippets.py --lang <lang>` for its own language as the final step of `make default`. The root `docs-test` target remains as a convenience to run all languages at once.
* Split every sub-Makefile `default:` into `default:` (build and system install) and `dev:` (full quality-check workflow). Both root Makefiles gain `<name>-dev` targets for each binding and crate, and an `all-dev` aggregate target.
* Split `dev/verify_snippets.py` into a lean orchestrator and a `dev/runners/` package. Each language has its own module (`python.py`, `julia.py`, `nodejs.py`, `r.py`, `wasm.py`, `rust.py`, `cpp.py`) containing its `run_<lang>()` function and a `skip_reason()` predicate. Shared types (`Snippet`, `RunResult`) and utilities live in `runners/base.py`; the registry (`RUNNERS`, `SKIP_CHECKS`) is exported from `runners/__init__.py`.
* Moved CHANGELOG and CONTRIBUTING guides to project root.
* Updated README files to be binding/crate specific instead of one generic README for all bindings/crates.
* Moved Node.js documentation from ReadTheDocs to GitHub Pages, served by Starlight at <https://thisisamirv.github.io/loess-project/nodejs/>. The ReadTheDocs site no longer includes Node.js-specific content. `dev/add-nodejs-outputs.js` runs as part of `make nodejs-dev`, executing each JavaScript code block in the docs and injecting its output back into the Markdown source.
* `make nodejs` (`default:`) now builds the native addon and links it globally via `npm link`. The full dev workflow moves to `make nodejs-dev`.
* Updated `oxlint` dependency to 1.80.

## Fixed

* Fixed `.cargo/config.toml` hardcoding absolute `c:/rtools45/...` paths for the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` linker and ar tool. Replaced with bare tool names resolved via `PATH`, matching the existing fix in `bindings/r/src/cargo-config.toml`.

# fastloess (Node.js) 1.0.0

## Changed

* Removed `dev/isolate_cargo.py`, `dev/check_root_cargo.py`, `dev/fix_doc_snippets.py`, and `check_js_licenses.js` — workspace isolation, doc-snippet transformation, and license checks are no longer needed.
* Split the monolithic root `Makefile` into per-crate/binding sub-Makefiles (e.g. `crates/loess-rs/Makefile`, `bindings/r/Makefile`), each invokable directly via `make -f path/Makefile`. The root `Makefile` now only aggregates (`docs`, `check-msrv`, `all*`).
* Moved Rust and binding tests into their respective crate/binding directories (e.g. `tests/loess-rs/` → `crates/loess-rs/tests/loess-rs/`, `tests/cpp/` → `bindings/cpp/tests/`). Removed the standalone `tests/` workspace packages.
* Renamed `OnlineOutput`'s `smoothed` and `std_error` fields to `y` and `standard_error`. This is a **breaking change**.
* Updated `@napi-rs/cli` to v3.8 and `oxlint` to v1.79.

# fastloess (Node.js) 0.9.0

## Added

* Added Python, R, WASM, Node.js, C++, and Julia bindings.

## Changed

* Implement monorepo structure.
* Converted all documentation tables to compact single-space format.
* Updated `.clang-tidy` to configure `lower_case` as the required naming convention for functions and member functions, matching the new snake_case public API.
* Moved `BENCHMARKS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` from the repository root into `docs/` and added them to the documentation site navigation.
