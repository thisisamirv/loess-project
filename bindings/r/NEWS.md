# rfastloess (development version)

## Changed

* Removed the `rfastloess-package` topic from the pkgdown reference index: its "Main Classes" summary duplicated the `Loess`/`StreamingLoess`/`OnlineLoess` entries listed right next to it, and roxygen2's auto-generated `rfastloess`/`rfastloess-package` aliases showed up as a confusing double entry. The topic is now tagged `@keywords internal` so `?rfastloess`/`?rfastloess-package` still work without appearing in the index.
* Unexported the internal `Nullable()` helper (dropped `@export`, its `NAMESPACE` entry, and its `man`/pkgdown Reference page); it was never meant to be called by users. Tests now access it via `getFromNamespace()`, matching the existing `coerce_nullable` convention.
* Added `dev/update_r_news.py` (since generalized into `dev/update_changelogs.py`, see **docs** above), run from `make r-dev`'s Documentation step, which extracts the `**R:**` entries from the root `CHANGELOG.md` and regenerates `bindings/r/NEWS.md` in CRAN's conventional per-version format.

# rfastloess 1.1.0

## Added

* Added `lenght` gaurds for extra arguments.

## Changed

* Moved R documentation from ReadTheDocs to GitHub Pages, served by pkgdown at <https://thisisamirv.github.io/loess-project/r/>. The ReadTheDocs site no longer includes R-specific content.
* Simplified `bindings/r/Makefile`: replaced `Cargo.toml.orig` save/restore vendoring with `src/vendor-update.sh`; made `[workspace]` permanent in `src/Cargo.toml`; removed Bioconductor dependencies, redundant `cargo fmt --check`, `NAMESPACE` indentation post-processing, and `pkgdown::build_site` from the dev workflow.
* Changed R version dependency to 4.4.0 due to issues with installing Bioconducter packages on R < 4.4.0.
* Replaced the multi-step `install.packages` / `BiocManager::install` package installation logic in `bindings/r/Makefile` with a single [`pak`](https://pak.r-lib.org/)-based block. `pak` handles RSPM binary vs source selection automatically (including Linux), skips already-installed packages, and installs CRAN, Bioconductor (`bioc::` prefix), and R-universe packages in one call.
* `make r` (`default:`) now runs `R CMD INSTALL $(R_DIR)` directly; R's `configure` script handles Rust compilation from the committed `vendor.tar.xz`. The full dev workflow moves to `make r-dev`.

## Fixed

* Fixed Windows arm64 (R-Universe) build: `ar x` without a member name correctly resolves long-name archive entries (>16 chars stored as `/<offset>`); named extraction silently fails for such entries. Used `objcopy --remove-section=.idata$4` on each extracted `.dll` stub to strip the invalid relocations that lld 19 rejects, then `ar r` to re-insert.
* Fixed `ld.lld` crashing or dropping symbols (`WakeByAddressSingle`, `WaitOnAddress`) on Windows arm64: `--whole-archive` pulls every crate's raw-dylib stub for a given DLL into the link, but different crates' stubs cover different, non-overlapping symbols of that DLL — `--allow-multiple-definition` works on x86_64 but crashes lld's arm64pe backend. Fixed by dropping `--whole-archive` on `gnullvm`; normal archive resolution applies and nothing is lost since `entrypoint.c` already references the extendr init symbol directly.
* Fixed CRAN Windows build (`error: linker not found`): `cargo-config.toml` hardcoded linker/ar as `c:/rtools45/...` absolute paths, which break when Rtools is installed on a different drive. Fixed by using bare tool names resolved via `PATH`.
* Fixed CRAN Windows build (`cannot find -lgcc_eh`): the Rtools gcc lib directory is not writable on CRAN's server, and config-file `rustflags` does not reach build-script linker invocations. `Makevars.win` creates an empty stub via `touch` in `$(TARGET_DIR)/libgcc_mock/` and passes `LIBRARY_PATH` inline on `cargo build`. The path is resolved to an absolute path via `$(pwd)` at shell execution time — a relative path silently fails because Cargo invokes GCC to link build scripts from its own temp directory, not from `src/`.
* Fixed `Loess(fraction = 0.3, 4)` incorrectly succeeding: `reject_extra_positional_args()` counted unnamed arguments but did not check their position, so a single unnamed arg in any non-first slot passed validation. The check now rejects any unnamed argument that is not in position 1.
* Fixed `fit()` and `process_chunk()` silently flattening a matrix `x` and producing a confusing Rust-level length-mismatch error when `dimensions` was not set to match `ncol(x)`. Both methods now raise an informative error at the R level, naming the `dimensions` parameter to fix.

# rfastloess 1.0.0

## Added

* Introduced S3 generics `fit()`, `process_chunk()`, `finalize()`, and `add_point()`, replacing the previous list-closure API.
* `bindings/r/Makefile` now auto-installs [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) if missing, before running `air format`.
* Added a `reject_extra_positional_args()` helper to reject extra unnamed arguments.

## Fixed

* Fixed incorrect URLs in R binding docs.

## Changed

* Renamed the `smoothed` and `std_error` fields returned by `OnlineLoess`'s `add_point()` to `y` and `standard_error`. This is a **breaking change**.
* Replaced `dev/style_pkg.R` with [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) for formatting.
* Removed `dev/fix_rd_style.R`, `dev/prepare_cargo.py`, `dev/patch_vendor_crates.py`, `dev/clean_checksums.py`, and `dev/prepare_cran.sh` — their logic is now inlined directly in `bindings/r/Makefile`, so the R build no longer requires any Python scripts.
* Added `...` to `Loess()`, `StreamingLoess()`, and `OnlineLoess()` to force named arguments for optional parameters.
* Added `Depends: R (>= 4.6)` to `DESCRIPTION` and a matching CI matrix entry.
* Expanded roxygen2 `@param` docs and added a `See Also` section linking to <https://loess.readthedocs.io/>.
* Expanded `rfastloess-intro.Rmd` vignettes.
